<h2> Execute the executable file </ h2>

Explains how to execute the executable file. Think of an executable as just a program. Running an executable file is synonymous with running a program.

<h3> Permission settings </ h3>

To execute an executable file, the file must have execute permission. Executables generated by gcc have execute permission by default.

Let's use the "-l" option of the <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/blog/20191126082723.html"> ls command </a> to see the execute permission of the file. ..

<pre>
ls -l
</ pre>

Only the executable file "test" has the execution permission "x".

<pre>
-rwxrwxr-x 1 kimoto kimoto 6702 Dec 14 14:42 test
-rw-r--r-- 1 kimoto kimoto 78 Dec 11 10:52 test.c
-rw-rw-r-- 1 kimoto kimoto 1488 Dec 14 14:37 test.o
</ pre>

As a reference, remember to use the <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/blog/20200519082545.html"> chmod </a> command to grant execute permission.

<h3> Execute the executable file </ h3>

To run the executable, specify the file name and press Enter.

<pre>
Executable file name
</ pre>

One caveat is that in <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com"> UNIX / Linux </a>, when executing an executable file in the current directory, add "./" at the beginning. It is necessary to turn it on.

<pre>
./test
</ pre>

You can also execute an executable file with an absolute path or a relative path.

<pre>
# Run with absolute path
/ foo / bar / test

#Run with relative path
bar / test
</ pre>
