<h2> Building a C language development environment </ h2>

I will explain how to build a C language development environment. Once you can use the <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/blog/20201216103956.html"> gcc command </a>, you will be able to compile and run C language. The gcc command is a method of compiling C language on UNIX / Linux, but now (written on June 21, 2021), it can be ported to Mac and Windows. I've seen other sites for beginners say that building a C language development environment is difficult, but I think it's easy.

<h3> Building a development environment for C language development environment on Windows </ h3>

For Windows, "How to use MinGW" "<a href="https://en.perlzemi.com/blog/20180806153350.html"> How to use msys2 </a>" "Use WSL2 to create a Linux environment" How to make it "and so on.

<h4> MinGW </ h4>

MinGW can be downloaded and installed individually, but it comes with Strawberry Perl, so <a href="https://en.perlzemi.com/blog/20180808153368.html"> Strawberry One way is to try installing Perl </a>. This is the easiest.

<h4> msys2 </ h4>

<a href="https://en.perlzemi.com/blog/20180806153350.html"> How to use msys2 </a>, once the procedure for building the Perl development environment is completed, C language development will occur naturally. The environmental procedure is complete.

<h4> WSL2 </ h4>

I think that installing Ubuntu is a natural way to use WSL2, so after installing WSL2, <a href="https://en.ubuntu.perlzemi.com/blog/20201123133738.html" Please refer to "> C language / C ++ development environment construction on Ubuntu </a>.

<h3> Construction of development environment for C language development environment on Mac </ h3>

On Mac, you can use the gcc command by installing the Command line tools for Xcode. The Mac gcc command is a wrapper for clang.

<h3> Building a C language development environment on UNIX / Linux </ h3>

Let's build a C language development environment with <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/"> Unix / Linux </a>.

You can install gcc using the commands (yum and apt) that install the packages provided by your distribution.

If you are in the C language development environment on Ubuntu, you can refer to the following contents.

A sample installation of gcc on Ubuntu.

<pre>
sudo apt install -y gcc
</ pre>

Install packages provided by the distribution in other <a href="https://en.linux.perlzemi.com/"> Unix / Linux </a> environments such as Debian, CentOS, FreeBSD, etc. You can do the same with commands (yum and apt).
