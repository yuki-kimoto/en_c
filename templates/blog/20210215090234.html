<h2> General-purpose pointer type --void * </ h3>

There is a general-purpose pointer type "void *" as a pointer type to which any pointer type can be assigned.

<pre>
void *
</ pre>

<h3> General-purpose pointer type sample </ h3>

This is a general-purpose pointer type sample.

<h4> Assignment to a general-purpose pointer and vice versa </ h3>

<a href="/blog/20210210082644.html"> malloc function </a> and <a href="/blog/20210209082644.html"> calloc function </a> return a value of type "void *" .. Let's actually declare a variable of type "void *" and assign it to another pointer type.

Let's also try assigning another pointer type to the "void *" type.

<pre>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main (void) {
  
  void * memory_block1 = malloc (sizeof (int32_t) * 10);
  void * memory_block2 = calloc (sizeof (int32_t), 10);
  
  int32_t * nums1 = memory_block1;
  int32_t * nums2 = memory_block2;

  void * memory_block1_again = nums1;
  void * memory_block2_again = nums2;
}
</ pre>

In C, no explicit cast is required to assign a void * type to another pointer type or to another pointer type.

<h4> Save int32_t type value in general pointer type variable </ h3>

This is a tricky method, but you can store a value of type <a href="/blog/20201130082751.html"> int32_t </a> in a variable of general-purpose pointer type. This trick can be used when "I implemented an array element with void * type, but uh, I want to save an integer as well, how do I do it?"

<pre>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void) {
  
  // void * Array with type as element
  void ** objects = calloc (sizeof (void *), 10);
  
  // Save int32_t type value in void * type element
  int32_t num = 5;
  
  // Cast int32_t type to intptr_t, then convert to void * and assign
  objects [1] = (void *) (intptr_t) num;
  
  // Cast void * type to intptr_t, then cast to int32_t type and get
  int32_t num2 = (int32_t) (intptr_t) objects [1];
  
  printf ("% d \ n", num2);
}
</ pre>

The point is to insert a cast of <a href="/blog/20210225131724.html"> intptr_t type </a> that is compatible with "void * type" and also compatible with signed integer type.

If you use this trick technique, please note that int32_t is used to work in both 32bit and 64bit environments. If you use <a href="/blog/20201127082751.html"> int64_t </a>, it will not work properly in a 32bit environment. The unsigned 32-bit integer type <a href="/blog/20201111150850.html"> uint32_t </a> can be used without any problem.

If you want to save floating point, <a href="/blog/20201202133213.html"> float </a> is 32bit wide, so it's OK. <a href="/blog/20201203133213.html"> double </a> is 64bit wide, so it's out.

<h3> void of void type and void of type * have the same meaning? </ h3>

No, the void type void is a special type that means "doesn't exist".

On the other hand, the void part of "void * type" means "general purpose (any type)".

<h3> What do you think about the explicit cast from void * to other point types? </ h3>

What do you think about the explicit cast from void * to other point types?

It's written as follows.

<pre>
  void * memory_block1 = malloc (sizeof (int32_t) * 10);
  int32_t * nums1 = (int32_t *) memory_block1;
</ pre>

This is not specifically required by the C language specification. On the other hand, the C ++ specification requires it.

If you don't need to be aware of C ++, it's verbose for the C language.

It's verbose, but I don't think it would have a particularly bad effect if it was written.

Even if I write it, I don't think it has a particularly positive effect.

It's a field that tends to get caught up in linguistic controversy, but in practice, I don't think it's that much of a concern.
